### about myself
I live in Minsk, Belarus. I am 20 years old. I am studying at the institute in a specialty that has nothing to do with programming. But no field of activity in our time can do without automating processes using computer programs or web applications. I consider it my mission to create new solutions for problems in my main field of activity (wood processing and timber production) by creating the necessary web applications. I am motivated to introduce new ideas that will help the overall development of the industry in the future. I would also like to be useful for other businesses in completely different areas. The main thing for me at the moment is to develop as much as possible as a web developer.
